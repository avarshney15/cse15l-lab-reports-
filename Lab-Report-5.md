Sociocultural theory originated with Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky, who carried out his highly innovative research during the 1920s and early 1930s, writing proliﬁcally on the contribution of social experience to children’s learning. After the Soviet Union’s twenty-year ban on Vygotsky’s writings was lifted in the mid-1950s, his major works reached the West. They began to be translated into English in the 1960s and 1970s.78 
By the 1980s, many American psychologists and educators—doubting the Piagetian view of development and desiring to account for wide variation in children’s competencies—embraced Vygotsky’s ideas with enthusiasm.79   
According to Vygotsky, infants are biologically endowed with basic perceptual, attentional, and memory capacities that they share with other animals. These undergo a natural course of development through direct contact with the environment during the ﬁrst two years of life, similar to the process of exploration and discovery described by Piaget. For example, all babies gradually distinguish objects and people in their surroundings and realize that these entities continue to exist when out of sight. They also merge objects that are alike into categories (such as vehicles, animals, birds, and eating utensils), laying the foundation for mentally representing their experiences and thinking eciently. And they become adept at imitating others, a powerful means for acquiring new skills. These and other infant capabilities set the stage for language, which develops with extraordinary speed after 1 year of age. By ages 2 to 3, most children are skilled conversationalists; by age 6, they have mastered most of the grammatical rules of their language and have vocabularies as 
large as ten thousand words.81
Vygotsky emphasized that to understand children’s development, it is necessary to understand the social situations adults devise for them. Any higher form of thinking, he pointed out, ﬁrst appears in social communication, between the child and representatives of his or her culture as they engage in a joint activity. Only later does it appear within the child, as an individual capacity or skill.83 The child’s mind, then, is a profoundly social organ. Through social life, it makes contact with and is inﬂuenced by other, more expert minds, permitting transfer of the values, knowledge, and skills essential for success in a particular culture.  
Because Vygotsky regarded language as the major bridge between our social and mental worlds, he viewed language acquisition as the most signiﬁcant milestone in children’s cognitive development. Language is our primary avenue of communication with others and means through which we represent our experiences. Once children start to think with words, language becomes an indispensable “tool of the mind.” Just as a hammer is a tool used to gain control over and transform physical objects, so we call on language to inﬂuence the thought and behavior of other people and ourselves.84
To illustrate how Vygotsky envisioned this close connection between social interaction and children’s thinking and behaving, let’s look in on another verbal exchange between a parent and a young child. Deb is pulling weeds in the garden while 2 1/2-year-old Maggy follows along, alternately digging with her small spade and 
holding a toy telephone to her ear. Soon gray clouds appear along the horizon, and thunder can be heard. Maggy, frightened by the booming sounds, whimpers to Deb, “Scary, Mommy. Go inside!”
