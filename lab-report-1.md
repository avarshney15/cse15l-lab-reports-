## Step 1: Installing VSCode
You should go to the website [VSCode download link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the software. After downloading it, you should set it up to the default settings. I had already downloaded the editor so I did not have to do it again. When it has finished downlaoding, you should open it and it should look like this. ![Image1](vscode.png)
## Step 2: Remotely Connecting 
To remotely connect you must first learn the username of your account. To do so please visit this ![site](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Then change the password using the forget password link in the page. Do not change the password of your TritonLink account as well. After you have changed the password the website should look like this ![Image](password-reset.png).
